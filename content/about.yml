skills:
- name: Go
  score: 50
  description: "It has became my language of choice, for most of new projects
  I am picking up. It has a lot of benefits, and the ease of use along with vast
  speed, made me fall in love with it. I feel confident with it, as I am using
  it widely in my everyday job."
- name: PHP
  score: 75
  description: "Over 5 years of experience with PHP, helped me to develop this
  skill almost to mastery. By playing around with many frameworks, such as
  [Laravel](//laravel.com/) & [Lumen](//lumen.laravel.com/),
  [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/), [CodeIgniter](//www.codeigniter.com/),
  [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/) & [Cilex](http://cilex.github.io/),
  and little bits of others, I am able to put together some amazing
  applications. I go around with Composer and PSRs, however I may be a little
  bit behind, due to my new role, especially with the new PHP 7 stuff."
- name: JavaScript
  score: 60
  description: "JavaScript, has been my daily bread for a while. I've got a lot
  of experience with [jQuery](//jquery.com/) and plugins written for it.
  Some time ago, I decided, I didn't like it that much and more often find
  myself trying to avoid using it. Lately, I'm dipping myself with some
  [Angular](//angular.io/) & [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/),
  [React](//facebook.github.io/react/) and ES6. I've done some WebGL
  stuff, therefore, I've also looked into: [Pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/)."
- name: HTML
  score: 90
  description: "Not much I could really say here... I try to keep my syntax neat
  and clean, use roles and appropriate tag elements where possible...
  I believe in the potential of HTML5!"
- name: CSS
  score: 90
  description: "I try to be up to date with css trends and functionality. I love
  SASS and prefer it over Less. I use [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/) very
  often and lately, I've started using [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/), in order
  to increase my productivity. Also, mobile-first!"
