    description: "It has became my language of choice, for most of new projects
    I am picking up. It has a lot of benefits, and the ease of use along with vast
    speed, made me fall in love with it. I feel confident with it, as I am using
    it widely in my everyday job."
  - name: PHP
    score: 75
    description: "Over 5 years of experience with PHP, helped me to develop this
    skill almost to mastery. By playing around with many frameworks, such as
    [Laravel](//laravel.com/) & [Lumen](//lumen.laravel.com/),
    [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/), [CodeIgniter](//www.codeigniter.com/),
    [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/) & [Cilex](http://cilex.github.io/),
    and little bits of others, I am able to put together some amazing
    applications. I go around with Composer and PSRs, however I may be a little
    bit behind, due to my new role, especially with the new PHP 7 stuff."
  - name: JavaScript
    score: 60
    description: "JavaScript, has been my daily bread for a while. I've got a lot
    of experience with [jQuery](//jquery.com/) and plugins written for it.
    Some time ago, I decided, I didn't like it that much and more often find
    myself trying to avoid using it. Lately, I'm dipping myself with some
    [Angular](//angular.io/) & [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/),
    [React](//facebook.github.io/react/) and ES6. I've done some WebGL
    stuff, therefore, I've also looked into: [Pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/)."

    description: "Not much I could really say here... I try to keep my syntax neat
    and clean, use roles and appropriate tag elements where possible...
    I believe in the potential of HTML5!"

    description: "I try to be up to date with css trends and functionality. I love
    SASS and prefer it over Less. I use [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/) very
    often and lately, I've started using [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/), in order
    to increase my productivity. Also, mobile-first!"
