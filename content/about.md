    description: "JavaScript, has been my daily bread for a while. I've got a
    lot of experience with [jQuery](//jquery.com/) and plugins written for it.
    Some time ago, I decided, I didn't like it that much and more often find
    myself trying to avoid using it. Lately, I'm dipping myself with some
    [Angular](//angular.io/) & [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/),
    [React](//facebook.github.io/react/) and ES6. I've done some WebGL
    stuff, therefore, I've also looked into: [Pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/)."

    [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/), [CodeIgniter](//www.codeigniter.com/),
    [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/) & [Cilex](http://cilex.github.io/),
    and little bits of others, I am able to put together some amazing
    applications. I go around with Composer and PSRs, however I may be a little
    bit behind, due to my new role, especially with the new PHP 7 stuff."
